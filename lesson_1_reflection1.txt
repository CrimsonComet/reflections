How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    If the previous version works fine then we can compare the changes because one of then is the bug. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    We can use "diff" command to compare our files, whenever they have been created.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    PROS ----->
    When I use GIT I can choose when I wanna build a commit and I can write some words. In addition, I can write a message to understand why I did that.
    
    CONS ----->
    I can lose some information, since the commit could be wrong build.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because one file can be linked to other files 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    "git log" is used to show all my project's commits and "git diff" to comapre two of them.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

    You can always return to a commit that works well.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Improve my programming skills.
